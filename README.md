# Assignment3

This assignment was to make a simple ASP.NET Core Web API to track movie franchises, movies and their characters.
It contains a database with some default characters, franchises and movies. The database was made using Entity Frameworks with a code first workflow.

The API should allow for basic CRUD functions for characters, franchises and movies.
It can also display all characters, franchises and movies.

The API is documented with Swagger.

## Background
